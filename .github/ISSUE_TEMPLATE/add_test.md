**Describe the implementation for which test is targeted**
<!-- Specify the condition to be tested -->
- API tested :
- API route : 

**Requirement of the test case**
<!-- If it other test cases exist for the implementation, then why is this test necessary, else just mention "Add a new test case" -->
- To publish only tested APIs as npm package
- this route comprises of
  - [no. of controllers] controllers
  - [no. of middlewares] middlewares
  - [no. of subroutes] subroutes 
- Must workaround at least some basic test cases to check if database responses.
<!--- Also check if sending OTP is successfully (if required) -->

**Expected behavior**
<!-- How the system should respond to the implementation -->
- All test cases should be well thought of.
- No redundancy in test cases.
- Test cases should be as minimally exhaustive as possible.
